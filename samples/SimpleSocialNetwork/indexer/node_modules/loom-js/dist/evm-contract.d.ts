 * The EvmContract class streamlines interaction with a contract that was

 * into and querying that contract.
 *
 * A contract instance can be used to listen to events emitted by the corresponding smart contract,
 * there is currently only one type of event. The event subscription API matches the NodeJS
 * EventEmitter API.
